# DIP
- An image may be defined as a 2-dimensional function,f(x,y) where x an d y are spatial coordinates and the amplitude of f at any pair of coordinates is called the intensity or the gray level of the image at that point.

- when x,y and the amplitude values of f are all finite, discrete quantities we call the image a digital image. The field of digital image processing refers to processing digital images by means of a digital computer.

- Pixels- An image is composed of a finite number of elements, each of which has a particular location and value.

- digital image preprocessing also involves working with images from ultrasound, electron microscopy and computer generated images.

- Low level process is characterized by the fact that both its inputs and outputs are immages.

- Mid-level processing on images involves tasks such as segmentation, description and classification. inputs - images; outputs - attributes extracted from those images.

- High-level processing involves "making sense " of an ensemble of recognised objects, image analysis.

- _Image Processing_: The process of acquiring an image of the area containing the text, preprocessing that image, extracting the individual characters, describing the characters in a form suitable for computer processing and recognising those individual characters.

- One way is to categorize the images by their source of origin(eg visual,X-ray). 
    - Principle energy source for images today- elctromagnetic energy spectrum. Others include acoustic,ultrasonix and electronic.
    - Synthetic images are generated by computers.
- EM waves can be seen as propagating sinusoidal waves of varying wavelengths. Each bundle of energy is called photon.

### Gamma-Ray Imaging
- Major uses of imageing based on gamma rays include nuclear medicine and astronomical observations.
- Images are produced from the emissions collected by gamma ray detectors. The patient is given a radioactive isotope.

### X-ray imaging
### Imaging in the ultraviolet Band

## Fundamental steps in digital image processing 
- _Image acquisition_: It is the most basic step, involves preprocessing such as scaling.
- _Image enhancement_: It brings out the details that is obscured or simply yo highlight certain features of interest in an image.

- _Image restotation_: it is an area that also deals with improving the appearance of an image. Enhancement is subjective, restoration is objective. They are based on mathematical or probabilistic models.

- _Color image processing_:  extracts fratures of interest in an image.

- _Wavelets_: foundation for representing images in various degrees of resolution.

- _Compression_: techniques for reducing the storage required to save an image or the bandwidth required to transmit it.

- _Morphological processing_: deals with tools for extracting components that are useful in the representation and description of shape.
- _Segmentation_: Partitions an image into its cinstituent parts or objects. 
- _Representation and description_: follows the output of a segmentation step, which is a raw pixel data, constituting either the boundary of a region or all the points in the region. Boundary representation is appropriate when the focus is on external shape characterstic such as corners and inflections. Regional representation is appropriate when the focus is on internal properties,such as texture or skeletal shape.
    - _Description_ also called as feature selection, deals with extracting attributes that result in some quantitative information of interest or are basis for differentiating one class of objects from another.

- _Recognition_: the process that assigns a label to an object based on its descriptors.

- knowledge about a problem domain is coded into an image processing system in the form of a knowledge database. This knowledge may be as simple as detailing regions of an image where the information of interest is known to be located.

## COMPONENTS OF IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM

- _SENSING_: 2 elements are required to acquire digital images. 
    - _A PHYSICAL DEVICE_: that is sensitive to the energy radiated by the object we wish to image.
    - _DIGITIZER_: for converting the output of a physical device into digital form.

- Image processing hardware consists of digitizers and hardware that performs other primitive operations such as an ALU.
- front-end subsystem

- The computer in an image processing system is a general-purpose computer. 
- _Software_: consists of specialized modules that perform specific tasks. 
- _Mass Storage_ Capability is a must in image processing application. An image of size 1024x1024 pixels, in which the intensity of each pixel is an 8-bit quantity, requires one megabyte of storage space if not compressed.
    - Storage falls in 3 categories:
        1. _short term storage_ for use during processing
        2. _on-line storage_ for relatively fast recall
        3. _archival storage_: characterized by infrequent access.
### Short term memory
- computer memory
- specialised boards; _framed buffers_; allows zoom, scroll and pan

- _Image displays_: Tv monitors.
- Hardcopy devices for recording images include laser printers, film camera, heat sensitive devices, inkjet units.
- _NETWORKING_: is almost a default function in any computer system. key consideration in image transmission is bandwidth
